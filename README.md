## alfred-terminalfinder

Alfred workflow to open current Finder window in Terminal/iTerm and vice versa.

**Attention:** you're currently seeing the branch for compatibility with iTerm 2.1.x. If you're looking for support for versions >= 2.9.x, see [the master branch](https://github.com/LeEnno/alfred-terminalfinder "LeEnno/alfred-terminalfinder").

## Usage

Install workflow and enter following keywords depending on what you want to achieve:

- `ft`: open current **Finder** directory in **Terminal**
- `tf`: open current **Terminal** directory in **Finder**
- `fi`: open current **Finder** directory in **iTerm**
- `if`: open current **iTerm** directory in **Finder**

Thanks to @olibob we also have [Path Finder](http://www.cocoatech.com/ "Path Finder 6 by Cocoatech") support:

- `pt`: open current **Path Finder** directory in **Terminal**
- `tp`: open current **Terminal** directory in **Path Finder**
- `pi`: open current **Path Finder** directory in **iTerm**
- `ip`: open current **iTerm** directory in **Path Finder**

In addition the search result in Alfred will show you what the action will do in its subtitle, i.e. `ft`:

This workflow was heavily inspired by [ssgreg's *Terminal in Finder's folder*](https://github.com/ssgreg/AlfredWorkflows/ "ssgreg/AlfredWorkflows · GitHub").
